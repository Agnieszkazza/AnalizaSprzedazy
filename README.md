# Project Description: Sales Data Analysis and Sales Forecasting Using an LSTM Model

This project presents an analysis of sales data and forecasts future furniture sales volume using an LSTM model. It utilizes the Streamlit library for visualization and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for prediction. The code analyzes revenue, customer behavior, segmentation, and returns, then builds a model to forecast future sales volume for the "Furniture" category.

## Required Libraries
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `scipy.stats`, `statsmodels`
- `streamlit`
- `tensorflow`, `keras`
- `sklearn`

## Code Structure

### 1. Data Analysis and Preparation
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
  - **Loading CSV File**: Data is loaded from a local CSV file containing online sales information.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Data is filtered to remove negative values and missing data.
  - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are removed to ensure the model can process the data without errors.
- **Sales Analysis**
  - **Creating Total Revenue Column**: Revenue is calculated based on `Quantity` and `UnitPrice`.
  - **Total Sales Revenue**: The total revenue is displayed to show the overall income generated by the company.
  - **Revenue by Category and Country**: Data is grouped and sorted by revenue for each category and country.
- **Sales Data Visualization**
  - **Revenue Over Time Plot**: Revenue is visualized as a time-series plot.
  - **Average Annual Revenue**: Average annual revenue is displayed on a plot.
  - **Top 10 Best-Selling Products**: The most frequently sold products are displayed in a bar chart.
- **Customer Behavior and Segmentation**
  - **Customer Segmentation**: Customers are segmented based on the average order revenue, and data is grouped by country and payment method.
  - **Returns Analysis**: Returns data is analyzed by country and payment method to see which segments are more prone to returns.
- **General Charts**
  - **Category Distribution**: A pie chart shows the percentage distribution of product sales across different categories.
  - **Payment Methods**: A chart displays the most commonly chosen payment methods by customers.

### 2. LSTM Model for Sales Forecasting
- **Data Preparation**
  - **Data Filtering**: Data is filtered to include only the "Furniture" category and orders where `Quantity` is greater than zero.
  - **Monthly Resampling**: The total furniture sold is aggregated in monthly intervals.
  - **Data Scaling and Differencing**: Data is differenced and scaled to better fit the LSTM model.
- **Sequence Creation**
  - The `create_sequences` function creates input data sequences and corresponding output values for model training.
- **LSTM Model Construction**
  - The LSTM model is built with three LSTM layers, each containing 200 neurons. Dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting.
  - A Dense layer at the end generates the predicted value.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**
  - **Model Training**: The model is trained on prepared data for 1000 epochs with a batch size of 32.
  - **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated based on metrics such as MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R².
- **Model Results Visualization**
  - Predicted sales values are compared with actual values, and results are visualized on a chart.

### 3. Model Metrics
The model is evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared error of predictions.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute error of predictions.
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination, measuring the model’s fit quality.

#### Example of Model Results Visualization
- **Actual vs Predicted**: A chart shows actual and predicted values of furniture sales volume over time.

## Execution
To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run <filename>.py
